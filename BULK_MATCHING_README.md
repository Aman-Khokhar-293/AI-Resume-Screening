## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Name/Email Extraction Logic

**Name Extraction:**
1. Scans first 5 lines of resume
2. Skips common keywords (Resume, CV, Objective, etc.)
3. Looks for 1-4 word lines with >80% alphabetic characters
4. Falls back to filename if not found (e.g., "John_Doe_Resume.pdf" â†’ "John Doe")

**Email Extraction:**
- Regex pattern: `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}`
- Scans first 15 lines

**Phone Extraction:**
- Pattern: `(555) 123-4567` or `555-123-4567` or `+1-555-123-4567`
- Used as fallback if email not found
